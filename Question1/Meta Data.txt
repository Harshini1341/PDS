1.Meta Data for Frailty
Frailty refers to a state of physical weakness and diminished health or strength. In the context of females, there is an observed correlation between reduced grip strength and higher frailty scores, and conversely, higher grip strength is associated with lower frailty scores. Grip strength is typically measured by quantifying the static force a hand can exert when squeezing a dynamometer, often measured in kilograms or pounds. The provided table contains data from ten female participants, with height measured in inches, weight in pounds, age in years, grip strength in kilograms, and frailty categorized as the presence or absence of related symptoms.
